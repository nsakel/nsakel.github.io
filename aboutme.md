> *"Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity."*  
> — **Horace Mann**

This quote has always expressed my aspirations in life.  
Beyond technology and work, I find meaning in contributing to something larger than myself — whether that’s through innovation, mentoring, or solving complex real-world problems.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy long conversations with friends about life and the challenges humanity faces — ideally over a couple of beers. You might also find me hiking, reading a good book with a cup of hot chocolate, or exploring my next investment opportunity. Occasionally, I work on [side projects](/projects) that blend curiosity, data, and creativity.

## 💼 Professional Overview

I’m **Nikos Sakellariou**, an **AI & FinTech Engineer** with a deep passion for **artificial intelligence**, **data systems**, and **product development**.  
Currently, I’m based in **Dubai, UAE**, working at **Rapyd.net**, one of the world’s leading FinTech companies. My focus lies in building reliable, data-driven backend systems for **payment reconciliation**, **billing**, and **settlement**, while leveraging AI to improve performance and automation.

Previously, I served as **Head of IT** and co-founder at [**NeuroHive.eu**](https://www.neurohive.eu), where I led research and development on deep learning algorithms that enhance agricultural productivity — part of which was later published in *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture* (Elsevier).  

Earlier, as **CTO** at [**In4Capital.com**](https://www.in4capital.com), I directed the redesign of a FinTech platform that connects startups and investors. The effort reduced development costs by **80%** and boosted user acquisition by **400%**.  
My experience also includes several **European Horizon 2020** and **Aspire2050** research projects, where I worked on deep learning, data fusion, and big data systems for autonomous vehicles and industrial anomaly detection.

## 🧩 Research & Technical Contributions

Throughout my career, I’ve designed and implemented:

- **Machine learning and statistical models** for anomaly detection in industrial machinery and autonomous vehicles  
- **Deep learning architectures** for multimodal UAV detection using data from optical, thermal, and radar sensors  
- **Big data architectures** for real-time sensor data retrieval from fleets of autonomous vehicles  
- **Cybersecurity dashboards** visualizing the operational health of autonomous systems  
- **AI algorithms** for diagnosing Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) performance issues  
- **IoT protocols and systems** for environmental pollution monitoring  

These projects reflect my belief that intelligent systems can — and should — solve tangible, human problems.
