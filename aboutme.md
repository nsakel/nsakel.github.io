*"Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity"*

is a quote by Horace Mann that express my aspirations in life. Besides all the things I do to achieve this, I truly enjoy hanging out with friends discussing their problems or humanity's problems over a couple of beers. Going for a hike at a mountain or spending time with myself reading books while drinking some hot chocolate or a cup of tea. In my spare time you may also catch me working on my side [projects] or researching for my next investment opportunity. 

### Experience
So, I am a software engineer with passion for Artificial Intelligence and its applications. I am currently working in a FinTech company - Rapyd.net one of the largest and most prominent companies in the payments sector. I also have long experience as a product manager from my days at In4Capital.com a matchmaking platform that bridges the gap between investors and startups. Finally I have been involved in many big research projects (such as European Horizon 2020 and Aspire2050), where I developed:

- Machine learning and statistical models for anomaly detection in industrial machinery and autonomous vehicles cybersecurity.
- Deep learning models for multimodal UAV detections utilizing diverse ground sensors (optronic and thermal cameras, 2D and 3D radars)
- Designed (and implemented) the big data architecture for retrieving real time data from multiple sensors of autonomous vehicles
- Designed cyber security dashboards for presenting the functionality of a fleet of autonomous vehicles
- Developed machine learning algorithms that detect Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) pathologies
- Developed protocols for IoT applications that retrieve enviromental pollution data
