## Professional Overview

I’m **Nikos Sakellariou**, an **AI & FinTech Engineer** with a deep passion for **artificial intelligence**, **data systems**, and **product development**.  
Currently, I’m based in **Dubai, UAE**, working at **Rapyd.net**, one of the world’s leading FinTech companies. My focus lies in building reliable, data-driven backend systems for **payment reconciliation**, **billing**, and **settlement**, while leveraging AI to improve performance and automation.

Previously, I served as **Head of IT** and co-founder at [**NeuroHive.eu**](https://www.neurohive.eu), where I led research and development on deep learning algorithms that enhance agricultural productivity — part of which was later published in *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture* (Elsevier).  

Earlier, as **CTO** at [**In4Capital.com**](https://www.in4capital.com), I directed the redesign of a FinTech platform that connects startups and investors. The effort reduced development costs by **80%** and boosted user acquisition by **400%**.  

My experience also includes several **European Horizon 2020** and **Aspire2050** research projects, where I worked on deep learning, data fusion, and big data systems for autonomous vehicles and industrial anomaly detection.
